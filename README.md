# Color-Transfer-Between-Images
Color transfer between images using Ruderman method in Matlab

In this project, I implemented an algorithm using Ruderman method to transfer colors in given source image to target image. This project has two parts.

I used this project for my Image Processing Class.

## Usage 
- _part1.py_ First part is a normal transfer, source's and target's sizes are not important. Just provide the images and run.
- _part2.py_ Second part is partial transfer. Code will look for most similiar part between images and transfer between them. Images' sizes should be same. You need to define x and y for area's shape that will be used for comparing.

In the report, you can find my comments and my results for this implementation.
